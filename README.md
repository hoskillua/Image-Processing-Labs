# Overview

This repo is a collection of all image processing assignments completed using SK-image in python in fulfillment of an academic image processing course.

## Lab 1 - Warm Up

A warm up lab on using SK-image functions and working with HSV colorspace and Histograms

## Lab 2 - Frequency Domain

Working with frequency domain and conversions between it and Spatial domain. Also, Applying Filters by Convulotion

## Lab 3 - Smoothing

Removing Salt & Paper Noise and Gaussian Noise; By Implementing Median and Gaussian filters.

## Lab 4 - Contrast Enhancement

Applying grayscale transformation techniques, mainly negative transformation, contrast enhancement, gamma correction, and histogram equalization.

## Lab 5 - Edge Detection

Implementing a few edge detection algorithms, Sobel and laplacian of gaussian, and comparing them with scikit-image edge detectors.

## Lab 8 - Adaptive Thresholding

Recursively splits image and applys thresholding to a local segment of the image. Some examples are shown below (middle image is the result of global thresholding and right one is local thresholding)
